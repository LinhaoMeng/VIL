/* jsconfig.json is a configuration file to assist your editor's Language Server (LSP) with the javascript usage in your project folder.

While it appears this has originated from VsCode, any editor using LSP will make use of jsconfig.json including VsCode, SublimeText and so on.

It's most commonly used to include/exclude folders in your intellisense (which nowadays most editors use LSP), and map aliases in your source code to certain folders. */
